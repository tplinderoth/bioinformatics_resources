#! Name of the job:
#SBATCH -J concat_atelopus_vcfs
#! Account name for group, use SL2 for paying queue:
#SBATCH -A bioinformaticscore

#! Number of nodes to be allocated for the job (for single core jobs always leave this at 1)
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#! Number of tasks. By default SLURM assumes 1 task per node and 1 CPU per task. (for single core jobs always leave this at 1)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#! How many many cores will be allocated per task? (for single core jobs always leave this at 1)
#! #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=36
#! Estimated runtime: hh:mm:ss (job is force-stopped after if exceeded):
#SBATCH --time=36:00:00
#! Estimated maximum memory needed (job is force-stopped if exceeded):
#SBATCH --mem=108000mb
#! #SBATCH --no-requeue

#! This is the partition name.
#! #SBATCH -p skylake-himem

#! mail alert at start, end and abortion of execution
#! emails will default to going to your email address
#! you can specify a different email address manually if needed.
#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL

#! module purge                               # Removes all modules still loaded
#! module load rhel7/default-peta4            # REQUIRED - loads the basic environment

#! Are you using OpenMP (NB this is unrelated to OpenMPI)? If so increase this
#! safe value to no more than 32:
#! export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
